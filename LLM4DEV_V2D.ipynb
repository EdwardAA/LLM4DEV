        "\n",
        "1.  **Go to the OpenAI API website**: Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)\n",
        "2.  **Log in or Sign Up**: If you don't have an OpenAI account, you'll need to create one. If you already have an account, log in.\n",
        "3.  **Navigate to API Keys**: Once logged in, look for the 'API keys' section in your account dashboard. You can usually find this by clicking on **API Reference -> organization settings**.\n",
        "4.  **Create a New Secret Key**: Click on the button to 'Create new secret key'.\n",
        "5.  **Copy Your Key**: OpenAI will display your API key. **Make sure to copy it immediately**, as it will only be shown once and cannot be retrieved later. If you lose it, you'll have to generate a new one.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Storing your API Key in Colab Secrets:\n",
        "\n",
        "For security, it's best practice not to hardcode your API key directly into your notebook. Colab provides a secure way to store secrets.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Open Colab Secrets**: In your Colab notebook, click the '🔑' icon in the left sidebar (it looks like a key). This will open the 'Secrets' panel.\n",
        "2.  **Add a New Secret**: Click on 'Add new secret'.\n",
        "3.  **Name the Secret**: For the 'Name' field, use `OPENAI_API_KEY` (this is a common convention and easy to refer to in code).\n",
        "4.  **Paste Your API Key**: For the 'Value' field, paste the API key you copied from the OpenAI website.\n",
        "5.  **Save**: Close the 'Secrets' panel. Colab will automatically save the secret.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, you can access your API key in your Python code like this:"
